# oolong
Oolong is an object oriented logging system for modern Fortran. The aim of this project is to provide a simple, flexible logging interface that will enable a wide range of logging functionality for a wide range of model paradigms.

The project uses FPM as a build system. Simply install FPM and use ```fpm build``` to build the oolong library. Examples can be run with ```fpm run --example```.
